-- #1 List all customers who live in Texas. Use JOIN.

-- First, I need to take a look at all the ids and columns.

SELECT * FROM customer; -- customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, address_id
SELECT * FROM city;     -- city_id, city which displays cities, country_id
SELECT * FROM country;  -- country_id, also the country column displays names of countries
SELECT * FROM address;  -- address_id, address, address2, district column which displays names of states, city_id, postal_code

-- Next, I will JOIN using customer.address_id and address.address_id.

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address, a.address2, a.district
FROM customer AS c
INNER JOIN address AS a
ON c.address_id = a.address_id
WHERE a.district LIKE 'Texas';



-- #2 Get all payments above $6.99 with the customer's full name.


-- Let me take a look at the 'payment' table.
SELECT * FROM payment; -- payment_id, customer_id, amount


-- I will JOIN using customer.customer_id and payment.customer_id

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, p.amount
FROM customer AS c
INNER JOIN payment AS p
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.amount > 6.99
ORDER BY p.amount DESC;


-- #3 Show the names of all the customers who made payments over $175. Use subqueries.
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id IN(
	SELECT customer_id
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id
	HAVING SUM(amount) > 175
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
);
-- Not sure how to format this to where it also displays the amounts.



-- #4 List all customers that live in Nepal. Use the 'city' table.


-- I've gotta look at this again.
SELECT * FROM country;  -- country_id, also the country column displays names of countries
SELECT * FROM city;     -- city_id, city which displays cities, country_id
SELECT * FROM address;  -- address_id, address, address2, district column which displays names of states, city_id, postal_code
SELECT * FROM customer; -- customer_id, store_id, first_name, last_name, address_id




-- I'll JOIN the 'city' and 'country' tables using city.country_id and country.country_id

SELECT *
FROM country
INNER JOIN city
ON country.country_id = city.country_id
INNER JOIN address
ON city.city_id = address.city_id
INNER JOIN customer
ON address.address_id = customer.customer_id
WHERE country.country LIKE  'Nepal';

-- Yeah... not sure if this is it or not...

-- #5. Which staff member had the most transactions?
SELECT * FROM staff;
SELECT * FROM payment;


SELECT staff_id, COUNT(staff_id)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM staff WHERE staff_id = 2;

-- #6. How many movies of each rating are there?
SELECT COUNT(film_id) FROM film WHERE rating = 'R';
SELECT COUNT(film_id) FROM film WHERE rating = 'NC-17';
SELECT COUNT(film_id) FROM film WHERE rating = 'G';
SELECT COUNT(film_id) FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG';
SELECT COUNT(film_id) FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13';

-- #7. Show all customers who have made a single payment above $6.99. Use subqueries. 
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id IN(
	SELECT customer_id
	FROM payment
	GROUP BY customer_id
	HAVING SUM(amount) > 6.99
	ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
);
-- I still don't really get this. Need to watch the video on subqueries. I get a lot of errors with other things I try.


-- #8. How many free rentals did our stores give away?
SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM payment WHERE amount = 0;
